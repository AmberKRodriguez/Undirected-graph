<h2>Project Requirment:</h2>  
<p>
programming project involves writing a program that allows the user to create an
undirected graph that is visually displayed and to check whether the graph is connected and
whether it has cycles in response to button clicks. In addition, it should provide buttons, when
clicked, display a depth-first or breadth-first graph search.
</p>

<h2>Scripts Explained:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a href="Vertex.java">VERTEX</a>: Class that defines a vertex of the graph and contains the x and y coordinates of the vertex along with its name.</li>
  <li><a href="Graph.java">GRAPH</a>: Class that defines the graph and allows unlimited number of vertices and edges. </li>
  <li><a href="GraphView.java">GRAPHVIEW</a>: Class that visually displays the graph. It contained an event handler that responds to mouse clicks that creates new vertices
and a method that is called to draw edges.</li>
  <li><a href="Main.java">MAIN</a>: Class that contains the main method and the GUI including all the buttons and text fields. It should include event handlers for each of the buttons.</li>
</ol>
